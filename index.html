            <p>Blobs is an implementation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boids">Boids</a>, 
                an artifical life algorithm developed by <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/index.html">Craig Reynolds</a> 
                that stimulates the natural flocking behavior of birds.</p>

            <p>The blobs follow three simple rules.</p>
            
            <ol>
              <li>Coherence - Each blob flies towards each other gradually, forming a cohesive flock.</li>
              <li>Alignment - Each blob tries to match the velocity of the boids around it.</li>
              <li>Seperation - The blobs will try to avoid running into each other, and if they get too close then they gradually steer away from each other.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>This project is largely inspired by <a href="https://eater.net/">Ben Eater</a> who has also implemented this algorithm on his site. You can view his demo <a href="https://eater.net/boids">here</a>.</p>
